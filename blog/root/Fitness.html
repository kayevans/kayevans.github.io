                    <h3>Nap Time Sweat Sesh</h3>

                    <p>A lot of people really liked the last workout I posted so I’m coming at you with another one!</p>
                    <p>Since then I have picked myself up some resistance bands and oh my do they make a difference! It’s amazing what body weight and a little bit of resistance can do! I also have a 10lb kettle bell.</p>
                    <p>Clearly not a lot of equipment, but still enough to get an awesome sweat on in just 30-40 minutes! 2 days after this workout and my body is still sore, so I know it worked!</p>
                    <p>Like I said previously I’m experimenting by making my own circuits. For the most part thus far they are generally full body! I’m not looking to build muscle until I get back to the gym, these circuits are just to get my heart rate up and get sweaty! I try to keep my workouts short enough to do while Ainsley is napping but still high intensity so I reap the benefits.</p>
                    <p>Hope you enjoy, if you do try it out make sure to leave a comment how you found it, and if you changed it at all! I’m always looking for new ways to change my workouts.</p>
                    <p>Full body circuit; repeat circuit constantly with minimal short breaks for 30 minutes</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Jumping jacks x50</li>
                        <li>Resistance band bicep curls x20</li>
                        <li>Mountain Climbers x50 (25 each leg)</li>
                        <li>Single leg deadlifts (10lb kettle bell) x30 (15 each leg)</li>
                        <li>Kettle bell swings (x20)</li>
                        <li>Resistance band upright rows (x20)</li>
                        <li>Jump lunges (x20)</li>
                        <li>Wide stance squats with 10lb kettle bell (x20)</li>
                        <li>Plank till failure</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>This gets me super sweaty and pretty tired, may not seem to hard in writing but if you don’t take long rests it’ll really get you. Generally I take about 30 seconds after a couple exercises, catch my breath and keep working!</p>
                    <p>Now get off your bum and go try it out!</p>

                        <h3>My Favourite Activewear</h3>

                        <p>I swear I own more activewear than any other type of clothing and I’m totally not sorry about it… I don’t even need to be working out to wear it, I’ll rock the “heading to the gym” look any day of the week. Athletic wear is just so much more comfortable, especially post baby.</p>
                        <p>I’m constantly buying and on the lookout for new activewear, I’ve found a couple pieces I love and that are absolute staples which I’m going to share today. And if you guys are interested in another post I’ll share items I did not like! </p>
                        <p>But enough chatting, I’ll just get into to my favourite activewear;</p>

                        <h5>Lulu Lemon Hi-Rise Wunder Under Full on Luxtreme</h5>
                        <img src="images/Wunderunder.jpg" alt="hi rise wunder under" >
                        <p>An absolute staple for anyone who works out. The Luxtreme fabric unlike Luon is more of a compression feel, it really sucks you in! I also find it more sweat wicking than the Luon. I use these leggings when I know I’m going to be working up a sweat. The high waist is also a must.</p>

                        <h5>Lulu lemon All the right places pant</h5>
                        <img src=images/Alltherightplacespant.jpg alt="all the right places pant">
                        <p>They have a fricken pocket you guys, A POCKET! Whoever thought to put a pocket on leggings is a genius, it’s so handy. I love these for at the gym so I can stick my phone in my pocket instead of stuffing it in my bra… Aside from the pocket these leggings are super comfy, sweat wicking, and durable! The super high waist is also nice when doing HIIT or cardio and my shirt is always flying around.</p>

                        <h5>Lorna Jane Twiggy Tight</h5>
                        <img src=images/twiggytights.jpg alt="twiggy tights">
                        <p>These tights are a material I’ve yet to find in any other tight. In the most positive way it almost reminds me of like a wet suit… I know that may sound unappealing but trust me they are SO soft and SO sweat wicking it’s insane! They are extremely comfortable and the most high waisted leggings I’ve ever seen. They just hold everything in and are perfect for cardio!</p>

                        <h5>Old Navy Go-Dry Strappy Mesh Tank</h5>
                        <img src=images/strappytank.jpg alt="strappy mesh tank">
                        <p> When it comes to tops, I’m not as picky as I am with my leggings. I generally don’t spend too much on my workout tops. I mostly get them from old navy (Canada) or cotton on body (Australia.) I have this specific top from old navy in about three colours and I love it! It fits well, is comfortable, and doesn’t show sweat easily.</p>

                        <h5>Live Fit Century Muscle Tank</h5>
                        <img src=images/LVFTshirt.jpg alt="lvft muscle tank">
                        <p>Although not as cheap as old navy, most certainly worth it. Live Fit’s muscle tanks are the softest things I’ve ever felt. Seriously it’s hard to explain the material, but it’s like your favourite T-Shirt times ten! I was sceptical on purchasing this because like I said I don’t like to spend money on tops, but now I have four so… That should say something!</p>

                        <h5>Live Fit Cropped Hoodie</h5>
                        <img src=images/LVFThoodie.jpg alt="lvft hoodie">
                        <p>I mean aside from the fact this is super adorable. I love this sweater for days I don’t plan on doing any cardio and want to keep warm in the gym. It’s cute, not too heavy so I don’t sweat like a maniac, and is the perfect amount of cropped to wear comfortably with high waisted leggings!</p>

                        <h5>Nike Free Run Flyknit</h5>
                        <img src="images/nikefreerun.jpg" alt="nike free run">
                        <p>If you are in the market for a running shoe, look no further. These are hands down the BEST running shoe I’ve ever owned. They weigh next to nothing and with the sock like fit, feel like you aren’t even wearing shoes! They are so stretchy and comfy, I could seriously walk or run forever in these. I wear low cut no show socks with these and they have yet to give me any type of blister! I wear these for cardio, lifting, or leisure! I love love love these shoes.</p>
                        <p>Those are my favourite active wear pieces that come to the top of my head. As you can see I didn’t include any sports bras, because I have yet to find a sports bra that I actually like! So PLEASE if you have a sports bra recommendation I’d love to hear it because I’m in serious need of a good one!</p>

                        <h3>At Home Full Body Circuit Workout</h3>

                        <p>While visiting here in Canada I chose not to join a gym. As much as it sucks because the gym is my happy place, I’ve been doing at home workouts to get those endorphins flowing!</p>
                        <p>Sometimes they involve a few more breaks than Id like thanks to Miss Ainsley. But it feels nice to get a sweat in regardless. Sometimes if she absolutely won’t cooperate I just switch my workout up and use her as a 14lb weight!</p>
                        <p>I make my own circuits since I have no weights, so my goal is to keep things fast paced to get and keep my heart rate up.</p>
                        <p>I usually do a circuit over and over again with no rests (unless I have a wailing baby) until 30 minutes is up! By the 30 minute mark I’m usually a sweaty mess anyways…</p>
                        <p>There are so many great at home circuits out there on Pinterest, or if you feel like spending money I highly suggest the Kayla Itsines guide. I use the Kayla Itsines workouts when I can’t make it to the gym, but like I’ve said lately I’ve been making my own circuits!</p>
                        <p>Here’s the circuit I did yesterday, if you take no rests and keep the intensity up I swear in just 30 minutes you’ll be sweating like a rat in a wool sock.</p>

                        <ol> 
                            <li>Skipping (if you don’t have a rope just do the arm motions): 1 minute</li>
                            <li>Pulse Squats: 20 reps</li>
                            <li>Burpees: 15 reps</li>
                            <li>Alternating Lunge: 20 reps (10 each side)</li>
                            <li>Jump Squats: 20 reps</li>
                            <li>Push-ups: 15 reps</li>
                            <li>Mountain Climber: 50 reps (25 each side)</li>
                            <li>Plank: 1 minute</li>
                            <li>Tuck jumps: 15 reps</li>
                            <li>Bicycle crunch: 20 reps</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Repeat until you’ve done 25-30 minutes! Then don’t forget to stretch, it’s very often underrated but is very important!</p>
                        <p>I’m pretty sore today which means it was a good workout! But keep in mind everyone is different so if you do try this and feel the need to modify it that’s okay! You can add your own things, add rest breaks, even add weights if you have them!</p>
                        <p>If you give this a go make sure to let me know how you liked.</p>
                        <p>Stay sweaty friends!</p>
